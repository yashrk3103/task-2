# 🎤 Phishing Email Analysis – Interview Questions & Answers

## 🎯 Outcome: Awareness of phishing tactics and email threat analysis skills

---

### 1. **What is phishing?**

Phishing is a type of cyberattack in which attackers impersonate a legitimate organization or individual to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or login credentials — often through deceptive emails or fake websites.

---

### 2. **How to identify a phishing email?**

Phishing emails often show:

* Spoofed sender addresses (e.g., [support@micros0ft.com](mailto:support@micros0ft.com))
* Urgent or threatening language
* Suspicious or mismatched links
* Unexpected attachments
* Grammar and spelling errors
* Failed SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks

---

### 3. **What is email spoofing?**

Email spoofing is when the sender’s email address is forged to appear as if it comes from a trusted source. It's commonly used in phishing attacks to deceive users and bypass simple security checks.

---

### 4. **Why are phishing emails dangerous?**

Phishing emails can:

* Trick users into giving away credentials
* Install malware or ransomware via attachments/links
* Impersonate financial or government services
* Lead to identity theft or company-wide breaches

---

### 5. **How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?**

* Check the sender's full email address
* Compare the return-path and domain names
* Inspect SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results in the email header
* Hover over links to view the real URL
* Contact the sender through a known, trusted channel

---

### 6. **What tools can analyze email headers?**

* [Google Admin Toolbox Header Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/)
* [MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)
* [Mailheader.org](https://mailheader.org)
* Manual inspection via raw header view in an email client

---

### 7. **What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?**

* Do not click any links or download attachments
* Mark the email as spam or phishing in your email client
* Report it to your IT/security team
* Delete the email from your inbox

---

### 8. **How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?**

Attackers exploit human emotions like fear, urgency, trust, or curiosity. They craft emails that appear to be from trusted sources (e.g., banks, bosses, government) to pressure recipients into taking immediate action, like clicking a link or sharing information.
